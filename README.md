# Sweeper
My old "minesweeper" game.

My first serious IT project, so it contains tons of bad (and strange) coding.
I tried to improve it, but soon realized that I had too much troubles with Swing framework.

The fresh code is in  [`enhance`](https://github.com/klevvit/Sweeper/tree/enhance) branch.
