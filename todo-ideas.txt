- Make static class (pull out from Game) with links to current game objects such as ImagePack, scale, etc.

- Stopped in Drawable. Image updates. We need to:
1. load all static images
2. update imageNow for all Drawables  // have unordered set of all drawables inside drawable?
3. repaint everything  // just call frame.repaint()?

- For scale change we need to:
1. update dimensions for all WindowElements
2. load all static images
3. update imageNow for all Drawables
4. repaint everything  // just call frame.repaint()?

Somehow we need to go through all window elements and then through all drawables.
Let's implement interface for returning WindowElements and Drawables element contains.
