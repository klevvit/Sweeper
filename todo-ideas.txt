- Make static class (pull out from Game) with links to current game objects such as ImagePack, scale, etc.

- Stopped in Drawable. Image updates. We need to:
1. load all static images
2. update imageNow for all Drawables  // have unordered set of all drawables inside drawable?
3. repaint everything  // just call frame.repaint()?
For scale change we need to:
1. load all static images
2. update imageNow for all Drawables
3. update dimensions for all WindowElements  // or do this first
4. repaint everything  // just call frame.repaint()?
